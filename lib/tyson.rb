Solar System Generator
Input: User trigers the program, inputs a solar system name.
Action: Program generates a star system with that name. It should generate planets within a given range based on the star class, in various orbital positions, determine if any of those planets are in the life belt, and if so, if life is present.
Output: The program will echo back to the user, in a formatted list, the statistics for his star system.

Class: Blueprint for an object. Must start with an upper case, and any of the

print "What is the name of this star system? "  - REACTIVATE THIS WHEN TESTING IS DONE puts "\tSystem Name: #{system}";
system = gets.chomp

Homework: Put all classes in this namespace format.  Tyson::System.new

Finish star - temp and color of stars by class.
clean this up so no duplication. Use case or hash, but refine the code.
Make multiple planets - display multiple planets with iteration and not with manual code.
